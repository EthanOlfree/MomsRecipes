# MomsRecipes
A website dedicated to my Mom's Recipes. 

Fore-word/Project Goal
For this project I hope to utilize coding multiple pages within a directory for different recipes.
Pages will include a different page for each recipe, a home page, an about page, and hopefully some images or a "we cooked this" pictures page.
I will do my best to complete the structure of this website with 5 recipe pages at least in under a week with cdontinued updates with new recipes as I cook them or as I recieve them. 
I also want to use this website as an opportunity to practice my CSS coding skills when I get more in depth with learning that. 11/21/22
